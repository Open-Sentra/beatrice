## Version History

- **1.0.0**: First stable release with professional features
- **0.9.0**: Alpha release for community testing
- **0.8.0**: Initial development version

## Migration Guide

### From 0.9.0 to 1.0.0

#### Breaking Changes
1. **Packet Structure**: The `Packet` struct has been replaced with a `Packet` class
   ```cpp
   // Old (0.9.0)
   beatrice::Packet packet;
   uint8_t* data = packet.data;
   
   // New (1.0.0)
   beatrice::Packet packet;
   const uint8_t* data = packet.data();
   ```

2. **Backend Interface**: The `ICaptureBackend` interface has been enhanced
   ```cpp
   // Old (0.9.0)
   virtual bool init() = 0;
   virtual Packet nextPacket() = 0;
   
   // New (1.0.0)
   virtual Result<void> initialize(const Config& config) = 0;
   virtual std::optional<Packet> nextPacket(std::chrono::milliseconds timeout) = 0;
   ```

3. **Error Handling**: Exceptions are now used instead of boolean returns
   ```cpp
   // Old (0.9.0)
   if (!context.initialize()) {
       // Handle error
   }
   
   // New (1.0.0)
   try {
       context.initialize();
   } catch (const beatrice::BeatriceException& e) {
       BEATRICE_ERROR("Initialization failed: {}", e.getMessage());
   }
   ```

#### New Features
1. **Configuration Management**: Use the new Config class for settings
   ```cpp
   #include "beatrice/Config.hpp"
   
   beatrice::Config::initialize("config.json");
   auto& config = beatrice::Config::get();
   std::string interface = config.getString("network.interface", "eth0");
   ```

2. **Logging**: Use the new logging system
   ```cpp
   #include "beatrice/Logger.hpp"
   
   BEATRICE_INFO("Application started");
   BEATRICE_DEBUG("Processing packet: {} bytes", packet.size());
   BEATRICE_ERROR("Failed to process packet: {}", error);
   ```

3. **Metrics**: Monitor performance with built-in metrics
   ```cpp
   #include "beatrice/Metrics.hpp"
   
   auto packetCounter = beatrice::metrics::counter("packets_processed", "Total packets processed");
   packetCounter->increment();
   ```

#### Build System Changes
1. **CMake Version**: Requires CMake 3.20 or higher
2. **Build Options**: New build options available
   ```bash
   cmake -DBUILD_TESTS=ON -DBUILD_DOCS=ON -DENABLE_SANITIZERS=ON ..
   ```

3. **Dependencies**: New optional dependencies
   ```bash
   # Install optional dependencies
   sudo apt install nlohmann-json3-dev libspdlog-dev libfmt-dev
   ```
